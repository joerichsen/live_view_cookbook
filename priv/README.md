# Welcome to the Phoenix LiveView Cookbook

### This repo contains examples of using Phoenix LiveView

Check out the live demo at https://liveviewcookbook.dev/

The plan is to have the following examples

- Form with validation
- Dynamic nested form
- Multistep wizard form
- File upload
- File upload to S3
- Picture upload and cropping
- Showing a Bootstrap modal
- Using a date picker
- Navbar

Feel free to add a PR if you think that an example is missing.
